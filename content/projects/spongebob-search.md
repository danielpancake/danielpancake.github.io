<mark class="highlight">spongebob-search</mark> is a command line application for searching through transcripts of Spongebob episodes from [Spongebob Wikia](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes).

<br />

**<!> NOTE:** As of 2023, the application has not been tested nor updated for a long time. It may not work as expected or may not work at all.

<br />

<mark class="highlight">spongebob-search</mark> uses simple full text search algorithm to search given words or phrases in the transcripts. I think, I used [this article](https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2020/07/28/lets-build-a-full-text-search-engine/) as guide. In terms of efficiency, it is very bad, as any sufficient data structures are not used. But it does (did at least) the job. Do not expect much, as it was simply a high school project.
