I made this project as a part of the Haskell course final assignment at Innopolis University. It\'s an racing game with pseudo-3d graphics made in Haskell. Most inspiration came from [Lou\'s Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126045954/http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/) and games like [Max DownForce](https://youtu.be/CJKgefRQh1I) and the original Out Run.
