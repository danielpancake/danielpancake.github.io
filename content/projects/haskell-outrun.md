I made <mark class="highlight">haskell-outrun</mark> for the final project of the Functional Programming course at Innopolis University. It is a racing game with pseudo-3d graphics inspired by the classic SEGA game Outrun. The game is written in Haskell and uses the [Gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) library for graphics and input handling. Most inspiration and guidance came from [Lou\'s Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126045954/http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/) and games like [Max DownForce](https://youtu.be/CJKgefRQh1I) and the original Outrun.



<br />

Features:

- Basic functionality for the Outrun-like game
- Methods to build custom racing tracks
- Infinite (looped) racing tracks
- Hills and curvy roads
- Static and dynamic road objects
- Game metrics: laps, time, and vehicle speed
- Sprite loading and sprite-based font loading
- Text rendering with a custom colour and font
