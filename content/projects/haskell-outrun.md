I created <mark class="highlight">haskell-outrun</mark> for the final project in my Functional Programming course at Innopolis University. It is a retro-style racing game with pseudo-3D graphics, inspired by the SEGA classic Outrun. The game is written in Haskell using the [Gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss){target=blank} library for graphics and input.

In developing, I turned to [Lou\'s Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126045954/http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/){target=blank}, [Max DownForce](https://youtu.be/CJKgefRQh1I){target=blank}, and the original Outrun for guidance and ideas.

<br />

Features:

- Basic gameplay elements of an Outrun-style racing game
- Customizable racing track building methods
- Infinite looping race tracks
- Rolling hills and winding roads
- Static and dynamic road objects
- Game metrics like laps, time, and speed
- Sprite and sprite-based font loading
