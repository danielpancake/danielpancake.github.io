> Gosha loves summer. He also loves his mom a lot. This summer, they went on vacation to the sunny beach. The sun shined on the screen of Gosha's old mp3 player while he listened to the new album from his favorite singer, Dmitry Kvadrat.

The winner of the local IGD (Innopolis GameDev) game jam, which was held at Innopolis University.
