<mark class="highlight">ShinyInu</mark> is an Android gallery app that shows random pictures of Shiba Inus from the [shibe.online](https://github.com/azrogers/ShibeOnline) webpage. It was made as a final project for the SAMSUNG IT SCHOOL in 2020.

- ...bookmark or save the best images
- ...share! hilarious and aww-inducing images
- ...get your daily dose of shiba cuteness for the good mood[^1]
