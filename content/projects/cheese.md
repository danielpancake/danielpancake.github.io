At the time, <mark class="highlight">"Cheese"</mark> is my most watched animation on the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@danielpancake0). It is based on one of the animations from the short series ["SHOP: A Pop Opera"](https://youtu.be/tSkz4vATkQE) created by very talented (!) [Jack Stauber](https://www.youtube.com/c/JackStauber).

Below, you can see most of the assets I created for this animation. I drew everything in the [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), using a mouse and a cheap graphic tablet.
An advice I'd like to give to the the *future me:* separate mouths from the head sprites. It will save you a lot of time!

After I finished drawing the faces, I began filming. I shot the video at 0.75x speed, so that movements would look better.

I usually use Magix Vegas Pro for video editing on my old laptop. There, I keyed out the background, tracked the movements of the my head, composed the frames, and added the audio. For the 3d text animation, I used Paint 3d.
