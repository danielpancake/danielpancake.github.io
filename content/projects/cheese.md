<mark class="highlight">"Cheese"</mark> is my most-watched animation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@danielpancake0). It's a recreation of an animation from the short series ["SHOP: A Pop Opera"](https://youtu.be/tSkz4vATkQE), created by the immensely talented [Jack Stauber](https://www.youtube.com/c/JackStauber).

Below are most of the assets I created for this animation. I drew everything in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) using a mouse and a graphic tablet.

> A piece of advice for my future self: separate the mouths from the head sprites (it will save you a lot of time!)

After finishing the faces, I filmed myself performing this little dance. I shot the video at 0.75x speed — makes the movements look smoother.

For editing, I used Magix Vegas Pro on my old laptop. I keyed out the background, tracked my head movements, composed the frames, and added the audio. The 3D text animation was created in Paint 3D.
