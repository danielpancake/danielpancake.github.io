<mark class="highlight">"Cheese"</mark> is my most watched animation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@danielpancake0){target=blank}. It is based on one of the animations from the short series ["SHOP: A Pop Opera"](https://youtu.be/tSkz4vATkQE){target=blank} created by the very talented [Jack Stauber](https://www.youtube.com/c/JackStauber){target=blank}.

Below, you can see most of the assets I created for this animation. I drew everything in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/){target=blank}, using a mouse and a cheapo graphic tablet.
Advice I'd like to give to my *future self:* separate mouths from the head sprites. It will save you a lot of time!

After I finished drawing the faces, I began filming. I shot the video at 0.75x speed - makes the movements look better.

For editing, I used Magix Vegas Pro on my old laptop. There, I keyed out the background, tracked the movements of my head, composed the frames, and added the audio. The 3D text animation was made in Paint 3D.
